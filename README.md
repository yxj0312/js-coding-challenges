## Code Challenges #11 - JavaScript Functional Programming

Three arrays are provided and each comes with 3 problem parts to be solved. In the first array:

Part 1 - Find all users older than 24

Part 2 - Find the total age of all users

Part 3 - List all female coders

In the second array:

Part 1 - List all users in the US in ascending order

Part 2 - Sort all users by age

Part 3 - List all female coders

In the third array:

Part 1 - Find the total age of male coders under 25

Part 2 - List all male coders over 30

Part 3 - Find the total age of everyone in texasss, newieyork and vegzas combined.

## Code Challenges #12 - JavaScript String Manipulation

In this challenge, we'll be solving five problems with possibly increased difficulty from first to last. The five problems are:

- Padded Number

In this challenge, an array is provided and stored in a variable, create a function which evaluates the strings in the array by adding a preceding 0 to single numbers (6 => 06, 5 => 05). Double figures remain as is.

- Camel-to-Title

Convert a given sentence from camel case to title case. Create a function which evaluates a given sentence argument in camel case and converts it to title case.

- Title-to-Camel

This the opposite of the last challenge, create a function which receives a string in title case as an argument and returns a converted version in camel case. Convert the given variable into a sentence with pairs of words in camel case. In cases where the word count is odd, leave the last word standing singularly.

- Passage Counter

This is a feature utilized by most blogs to calculate reading time. Create a function which calculates the time to read a text in seconds, if it takes over 60 seconds to read a passage return the time to minutes.

- Pig Latin

Quite an interesting challenge, convert any given word to Pig Latin. Create a function which receives an argument of a string and subsequently returns the Pig Latin version of it. Here's how to convert words to Pig Latin:

    - In words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added.

    - When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole consonants before the vowel is added at the end followed by an "ay".

    - In words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "ay" to the end.
    
## Code Challenges #10 - Lazy Load Animal Memes with Intersection Observer

### Requirement

Feel free to complete this challenge using any tool, technique, or technology. However, there is a single requirement for the challenge which is, once the application loads, we require only the images in the viewport to load, while the rest of the images not currently in the viewport loads upon entering the viewport.

### Goals for this Challenge

- Implement lazy loading on a page to reduce its load time and improve performance.

- Understand DOM element manipulation using JavaScript.

## Code Challenges #9 - Build A Scroll-Spy Navbar

### Requirement

Once a portion of the page is scrolled to, its corresponding navigation link on the navigation bar should be highlighted.

### Goals for this challenge

- Implement scroll-spy on a page by tracking portions or elements in the page and highlighting the navbar.

- Understand DOM traversing and manipulation.
